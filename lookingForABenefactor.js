// The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?

// if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149

// The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg.

// Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us to throw an error

// (return Nothing in Haskell, return None in F# and Ocaml, return -1 in C, Fortran, Nim, echo ERRORin Shell)

// so that he clearly sees that his expectations are not great enough.

// Notes:

// all donations and navg are numbers (integers or floats depending on the language), arr can be empty.
// See examples below and "Test Samples" to see which error is to be thrown.
// new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
// new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2) 
// should raise an error (ValueError or invalid_argument or DomainError) 
// or return `-1` or ERROR depending on the languagefunction newAvg(arr, newavg) {
    function newAvg(arr, newavg) {
        let reducedArr = arr.reduce((x,y) => x + y, 0);
        let numOfDonations = arr.length - 1;
        let averageN = reducedArr / numOfDonations;
        let missingAverage = newavg - averageN;
        
        let result =  newavg * (arr.length +1) - reducedArr;
        if(result <= 0) throw "ValueError";
        return Math.ceil(result);
