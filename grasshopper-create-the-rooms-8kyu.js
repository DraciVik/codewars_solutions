// Escape the room

// You are creating an escape the room game. The first step is create an object called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. The room object should have at least 3 rooms as properties, and each individial room should have at least three properties (example: name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
const rooms = {
        killingRoom: {
                name: 'Killing Room',
                description: 'People get killed here',
                completed: false,
        },
        waitingRoom: {
                name: 'Waiting Room',
                description: 'People wait here',
                completed: false,
        },
        runningRoom: {
                name: 'Running Room',
                description: 'People run here',
                completed: false,
        },
};
